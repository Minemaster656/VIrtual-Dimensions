    <string name="tt_phase0">At the beginning of the game you have access to only 1 tab besides training - phase 0. You have the number of virtual particles (top left corner) and the number of virtual clusters (top right corner). Clusters are obtained from particles, and the next cluster has a markup of *1.1. \nYou have a big cyan button on the left. Clicking it will give you particles. The button on the right is an increase in force for clusters. Below the 2 buttons - increase the duration of the particles and the divider. When the time expires, the particles are divided by the divider. Even lower is the Prestige button (red button) and to the right of it is the prestige multiplier. Prestige restarts the game from the beginning, but gives a cluster-based bonus. Still below are 2 buttons, the Push Strength Multiplier (left) and the Cluster Markup Reduction (right). \nNext, after getting 200 clusters and reducing the divider to 5, you will unlock a new enhancement, Quantum Physics Breakdown. After buying it the particles will stop disappearing, and you will also get another button - to break the law of conservation of energy. It will block access to this stage of the game, but will give access to the rest.</string>

    <string name="tt_dims">Dimensions:\nYou have six dimensions. They all have a amount, a multiplier and a number of purchases.\nThe amount is calculated based on the formula: amount * multiplier of the measurement above. The same formula for calculating the production of virtual particles - game currency. They are produced by the first dimension.\nThe multiplier is calculated by the formula: ((amount / 1e10) * multiplier from collapses) + amount of purchases^3</string>
    <string name="tt_tickspeed">Tickspeed:\nYou have tickspeed upgrade. Its cost is multiplied by 10 for each purchase. Also, each purchase gives an additional multiplier to all measurements. The multipliers add up. Normally it is 0.2 per purchase, but after purchasing the "clear the void" upgrade in the Quarks tab, the multiplier becomes 0.7 per purchase.</string>
    <string name="tt_e">Scientific Notation.\nYou may have noticed that all numbers greater than 10,000,000 are written with an "e". This is scientific notation. The number before e is the mantissa. The number after e is the exponent. If you translate it into normal notation, you get mantissa*(10^exponent). It follows that the exponent is the number of zeros in the number.</string>
    <string name="tt_collapse">Collapse.\nCollapse is a way of obtaining an additional multiplier to the dimensions. When you collapse you lose everything, but you gain a *2 multiplier for the collapse. The multipliers add up. Also, the collapse price is multiplied by 1e50 for each purchase. also, the markup itself is multiplied by 1e5 per purchase.</string>
    <string name="tt_quarks">Quarks.\nIf you have reached 1e100 VP, you can reset your progress to obtain quarks. Number of quarks in annihilation = exponent of virtual particles / 100 (log(VP)/100). Quarks are needed for powerful upgrade.</string>
